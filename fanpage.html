		<h3>Bio</h3>
			<p>Portugal, the Man is a band that originated from Alaska and adopted Portland as their current home. In fact they commonly refer to themselves as "The Lords of Portland." They have been signed to Fearless Records and currently Atlantic Records. The band has been somewhat of a revolving door for artists. Currently they have 5 members, but there are also 7 past members.</p>
			<p>PTM, is a very socially and enviornmentally conscious band. They partnered with the Smithsonian National Zoo to release a limited run of 400 special records to help raise awareness for critically endangered Sumatran Tigers. The records, however, were never released digitally but rather, were sent to specific influencers around the world to help start a grass root type movement .</p>
